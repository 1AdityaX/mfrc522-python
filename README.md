## Introduction
### **MFRC522**
The MFRC522 is a popular RFID module that supports contactless communication using the 13.56 MHz frequency. It can read and write data to RFID cards or tags, making it ideal for projects that require identification or access control. This repository provides a library and example code to interact with the MFRC522 module using various microcontroller platforms.

### **Sectors and Blocks**
Sectors and Blocks refer to the organization and structure of memory on an RFID tag or card.
<br>
The memory of card is divided into **16 sectors** (for classic MIFARE 1k). Each sector contains **4 blocks** and each block can hold upto **16 bytes of data**.
<br>
So a classic MIFARE 1k has **16 sectors, 64 blocks (16  sectors x 4 blocks)  and can hold upto 1024 bytes (64 blocks x 16 bytes)**  in total.
<br>
Not Every blocks are writeable, the first block of the first sector and the last block of every sectors are not writeable.
The first block of **first sector typically holds the manufaturer's details** *(like **manufacturer's identification number (MID) and the application identifier (AID)**. The MID is a unique number that identifies the manufacturer of the card. The AID is a unique number that identifies the application that is stored on the card.)*. **The last block of every sector is called a trailer block**, the trailer block contains information about the sector, such as the **sector number, the number of blocks in the sector, and the checksum**. The checksum is used to verify the integrity of the data in the sector. **If you ever write to a trailer block then the entire sector will be unwritable.**

| Sectors | Block Number   |
|---------|----------------|
| 0       | 0, 1, 2, 3     |
| 1       | 4, 5, 6, 7     |
| 2       | 8, 9, 10, 11   |
| 3       | 12, 13, 14, 15 |
| 4       | 16, 17, 18, 19 |
| 5       | 20, 21, 22, 23 |
| 6       | 24, 25, 26, 27 |
| 7       | 28, 29, 30, 31 |
| 8       | 32, 33, 34, 35 |
| 9       | 36, 37, 38, 39 |
| 10      | 40, 41, 42, 43 |
| 11      | 44, 45, 46, 47 |
| 12      | 48, 49, 50, 51 |
| 13      | 52, 53, 54, 55 |
| 14      | 56, 57, 58, 59 |
| 15      | 60, 61, 62, 63 |

Manfacturer's details is stored in block number 0  and 
Trailer blocks are 3, 7, 11, etc,.
<br>
**( Tips: It's better to not store any data in the first sector. Start from the first sector )**
<br>
**Note: Different cards have diiferent number of sectors and blocks. For example, Classic MIFARE 4k has 40 Sectors. It's better to check the datasheet for the RFID tag/card you use before writing data to it.**

## Usage
### Using `MFRC522` class
1. Import and create an instance of class `MFRC522` from `mfrc522` module.
```py
from mfrc522 import MFRC522

reader = MFRC522() 
```
2. Request communication with a PICC *(Proximity Integrated Circuit Card A.K.A rfid card)* and check if the communication is established.
```py
status =  None
while status != reader.MI_OK:
	(status, TagType) = reader.Request(reader.PICC_REQIDL)
	if status == reader.MI_OK:
		print("Connection Success!")
```
3.  Perform an Anti-collision Algorithm *(Picks one rfid card if multiple cards are placed )* and return the UID.
```py
(status, uid) = reader.Anticoll()
if status == reader.MI_OK:
	print(uid)
```
4.  Select the tag to Authenticate and perform funtions like reading or writing data to the card.
```py
reader.SelectTag(uid)
``` 
5. Authenticate a particular sector with a key to read or write data to it.
```py
trailer_block = 11
#This is the default key for MIFARE Cards
key = [0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF , 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF]
status = reader.Authenticate(
        reader.PICC_AUTHENT1A, trailer_block , key, uid)
```
6. Now read or write to the block numbers in the sector that you have authenticated.

**To read**
```py
block_nums = [8, 9, 10]
data = []
for block_num in block_nums:
	block_data = reader.ReadTag(block_num)
	if block_data:
		data += block_data
if data:
	print(''.join(chr(i) for i in data))
```
**To write**
```py
block_nums = [8, 9, 10]
text = "Hello, World"
data = bytearray()
data.extend(bytearray(text.ljust(  len(block_addrs)  *  16).encode('ascii')))
i = 0
for block_num in block_addrs:
	reader.WriteTag(block_num, data[(i*16):(i+1)*16]) 
	i +=  1
```
7. Once you business with the RFID card or Tag is over. Always Stop the Authenciation/communiction with the card.
**Note: If you miss out this step, you won't be able to use a different card.**
```py
reader.StopAuth()
```

### Using `SimpleMFRC522` class
1. Import and create an instance of class `SimpleMFRC522` from `mfrc522` module
```py
from mfrc522 import SimpleMFRC522

reader = SimpleMFRC522()
```
2. Use `read()`  to read and `write()` to write
**To read** 
```py
id, text = reader.read()
print(f"ID: {id}")
print(f"Text: {text}")
```
**To write**
```py
text = "hello_world"
id, text_written = reader.write(text)
print(f"ID: {id}")
print(f"Text Written: {text_written}")
```
